\section{Conclusion}
In this report several different methods to regularize noisy problems have been discussed. To balance damping and oscillating of the solution the L-curve has been discussed. Including an automatic mechanism to pick a good regularization parameter. Tikhonov's method produced good results. The same method also worked with generalized cross validation. Tsvd, Dsvd and conjugate gradient methods produce noisy L-curves. Often these curves are equally good from a regularization point of view. But it is hard to choose a good regularization parameter automatically using curvature data computed from derivatives. Sometimes filtering of the noisy data can lead to acceptable approximations. The use of GCV in connection with these methods should be investigated further. It might prove to be more noise resistant. Due to time constraints this is outside of the scope of this report. Finally the Picard condition has been checked for filtered and unfiltered problems when using Thikonov regularization. Evaluation of the results provides reason to believe that all six problems have been correctly regularized.
