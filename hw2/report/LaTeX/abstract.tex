\section{Abstract}
When solving $\|\mathbf{Ax} - \mathbf{b}\|$ for very large $\mathbf{A}$
the memory requirements do not allow it to let the \texttt{GMRES} algorithm iterate until convergence, as memory and computational cost increases with each step. Therefore a modified version of \texttt{GMRES} called restarted \texttt{GMRES(m)} has been proposed by Saad and Schultz in their original paper\footnote{A Generalized minimal residual algorithm for solving nonsymmetric linear systems, SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput. Vol 7, No.3 1986}. After a fixed amount of iterations \texttt{m} the algorithm is restarted using $\mathbf{x}_m$ as initial condition for the next run. This changed version  avoids memory problems at the cost of convergence. One would expect that the larger $m$ is chosen the better the convergence properties of the restarted would be. However this is not always the case. In this report this curious behavior will be investigated following the paper \textquotedblright The Tortoise and the Hare, Restart GMRES\textquotedblleft  \footnote{SIAM Rev., 45(2), 259â€“266.
