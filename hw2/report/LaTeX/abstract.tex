\section{Abstract}
When solving $\|\mathbf{Ax} - \mathbf{b}\|$ for very large $\mathbf{A}$
the memory requirements do not allow it to run the algorithm in on iteration until convergence. Therefore a modified version of \texttt{GMRES} called restarted \texttt{GMRES(m)} is often used. After a fixed amount of iteration \texttt{m} the algorithms is restarted using $\mathbf{x}_m$ as initial condition for the next run. This changed version  avoids memory problems at the cost of convergence. One would expect that the larger $m$ is chosen the better the convergence properties of the restarted would be. However this is not always the case. In this report this curious behaviour will be investigated following the paper \textquotedblright The Tortoise and the Hare Restart GMRES\textquotedblleft  \footnote{SIAM Rev., 45(2), 259â€“266.
