\section{Conclusion}
In this report the results of Embree's paper \textquotedblleft The Tortoise and the Hare, Restart GMRES \textquotedblright have been successfully reproduced. Just like in the tortoise the hare in the fairytale \texttt{GMRES(1)} is able to beat (\texttt{GMRES(2)}) if specific matrices are considered. As to why this happens remains unknown. Additional experiments confirmed the link between \texttt{GMRES(m)} convergence and the conditioning of the problem that was already observed in the first report. However this report showed clearly that the initial condition plays a key role as well.
