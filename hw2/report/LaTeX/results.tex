\subsection{\texttt{Gmres(m)} convergence on a larger random matrix}
Before the results from the paper are considered \texttt{gmres(m)} will be run on a random matrix of dimension $60$, the restart parameter will be varied and the effects on convergence observed. Results are shown in figure~\ref{fig:randCompM}.
In the plot a large spice is observed. In fact \texttt{gmres(34)} seems to have better convergence properties, then \texttt{gmres(35)}.

\subsection{Experiments done in the paper}
Embree considers two examples in his paper, the first one using
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\;\;\; 
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix}
2 \\ -4 \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The second being
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & -2 \\
0 & 2 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 3 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\;\;\;
\mathbf{b} =
\begin{pmatrix}
3 \\
1 \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Using series expressions as provided in the paper the convergence plots for \texttt{GMRES(1)} and \texttt{GMRES(2)} have been computed, the results shown in figure~\ref{fig:ConvergenceFig1AndFig3} resemble plots one and three in the paper. However to truly understand the gravity of the phenomenon $\mathbf{b}$ has been replaced with 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r_0} = \begin{pmatrix}
\xi \\ \eta \\ 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
If $\xi \text{ and } \eta \in [-10,10]$ the plots shown in figures~\ref{fig:fig2} and \ref{fig:fig4}. Can be computed, which are the same as figure 2 and 4, if the different coloring is neglected. These plots show the residual of the two schemes after 30 iterations on a logarithmic scale. Blue areas indicate convergence.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Additional experiments}
If $A - 0.35*\mathbf{I}$ is considered the condition number changes from $\kappa(\mathbf{A}) = 14.2950$ to  $\kappa(\mathbf{A} - 0.35*\mathbf{I}) = 39.1873$. At the same time the convergent area of \texttt{GMRES(1)} shown in figure~\ref{fig:modA}, shrinks considerably in comparison to the plot~\ref{fig:fig2}. Additionally as the conditioning worsened the white foggy areas without convergence grew significantly. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{../src/figure/Am0p35eyeGMRES1}

\caption{\texttt{GMRES(1)} and \texttt{GMRES(2)} convergence on $\mathbf{A} - 0.35 \cdot \mathbf{I}$.  } 
\label{fig:modA}
\end{figure}

In a second series of experiments, designed to further investigate the effect of changed conditioning, $\mathbf{A}$ will be filled with entries drawn from the standart normal distribution ($\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2 = 1$). The values turned out to be:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = \begin{pmatrix}
-0.3034 &   0.8884 &  -0.8095 \\
 0.2939 &  -1.1471 &  -2.9443 \\
-0.7873 &  -1.0689 &   1.4384 \\
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}
Results for \texttt{GMRES(1)} and \texttt{GMRES(2)}. Are shown in figure \ref{fig:randAGMRES2}. Here it can be observed, that \texttt{GMRES(2)}, converges for all possible right hand sides $\mathbf{b}$, while \texttt{GMRES(1)} does not. This is probably the more common, but mathematically less interesting case. Often convergence improves significantly if the identity matrix is added to A. Unfortunately the condition number got worse by adding one multiple of the identity. It increased from $\kappa(\mathbf{R})=5.1025$ to $\kappa(\mathbf{R} + \mathbf{I})=32.4770$. Adding two times the identity matrix makes matters even worse as $\kappa(\mathbf{R} + 2\mathbf{I})=77.5446$, with results shown in figure~\ref{fig:randAp2eyeGMRES2}. Finally adding three times the identity leads to $\kappa(\mathbf{R} + 3\mathbf{I})=6.4262$ and complete convergence for both algorithms figure~\ref{fig:randAp3eyeGMRES2}. However the conditioning is still worse then it was originally, which indicates that conditioning alone cannot be used to predict \texttt{GMRES(m)} convergence.

\subsection{Two-Dimensional case}
At the end of the paper Embree proposes to take a closer look at:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & -2 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\;\;\;
\mathbf{r_0} = \begin{pmatrix} \xi \\ \eta \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The residuals show noisy convergence patterns in the bottom and top corners for \texttt{GMRES(1)} in figure~\ref{fig:fig4}. On the right side seemingly random patterns are shown at larger magnification.
Similar ones appeared in figure \ref{fig:fig4} when zooming in. No plot exists for \texttt{GMRES(2)} is it always converged completely within two iterations. In fact for all of the approximately ten two by two matrices that where tried did \texttt{GMRES(2)} converge to the exact result.

\subsection{An attempt to learn more about the noise.}
In the zoom on figure~\ref{fig:twoDZoom} reveals a noisy area where the outcome of running restart gmres cannot be predicted. This section aims at learning more about the noise. In a first attempt a histogram of the residual magnitude shown in figure~\ref{fig:gmresCHist}, has been made. On the right a zoom on the bottom right part of the histogram is shown, such that parts of the line at zero are neglected. The bar at zero is therefore considerably higher then the one shown. However as most of the surface plot is colored in yellow which corresponds to an error size of $10^0$, this does not come as a surprise that in a histogram of the same image the line at $10^0$. It is rather of more interest do consider the distribution of errors smaller then $10^0 = 1$. And here another peak is observed in bin $[-1.7 -1.6]$, which creates the impression that the noise consists of two superposed noise distribution. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:randnHist} noise with a similar distribution can be produced by superposing shifted absolute valued normal distributions. Finally~\ref{fig:gmresBHist} shows a histogram for the residuals found in the convergence plain of matrix $\mathbf{B}$, interestingly it seems to consists of three superposed distribution. A link between matrix dimensions can not be confirmed by a histogram of $\mathbf{A}$ which only displays two very large bins like $\mathbf{C}$ does.

\subsection{Stagnation condition}
Using the recurrence relation for \texttt{gmres(1)}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^{(1)} = \mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)} - \frac{\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)T}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)}}{\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)T}\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)}} \mathbf{A}\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)},
\end{equation}
with $\mathbf{r}_{0} = (\xi \; \eta \; 1)$ it follows that \texttt{gmres(1)} must stagnate if $\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)T}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{r}_{k}^{(1)} = 0$. Using the condition above the two elpsoids
\begin{align}
\xi^2 + \xi \eta + \xi + \eta^2 + 3\eta + 1 = 0, \\
\xi^2 + 2\xi \eta -2\xi + 2\eta^2 + 4\eta + 3 = 0
\end{align}
can be found. Which is a set of points on which the algorithms stagnates.
